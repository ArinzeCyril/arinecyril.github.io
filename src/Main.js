            <p>Hello! I am a Frontend Developer and I enjoy 
              creating things that lives on the internet. I am particularly 
              interested in building high performing web pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I create responsive websites that are fast, easy to use and are built with the best
            practices. Currently, the main area of my expertise is frontend development,
            though I do a little bit of backend and database.
        </p>
          <p> My interest in web development started back in 2016 and since then, 
              I have become much better at it and I have been able to complete a number of
              projects and also worked with a team of developers.
